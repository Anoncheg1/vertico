#+title: minicomp.el - Minimalistic vertical minibuffer completion system
#+author: Daniel Mendler
#+language: en

* Introduction

This package provides a vertical completion system, which is based on the
default completion system. By reusing the default system, we achieve full
compatibility with built-in Emacs commands and completion tables. The completion
system is pretty bare-bone and only provides a minimal set of commands. The code
base is less than 500 lines of code. If you are looking for a more full-featured
package, you may be interested in [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][Selectrum]]. Selectrum supports Avy-style quick
keys, a horizontal display and a buffer display.

Complementary packages, which are supported:

- [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia][Marginalia]]: Rich annotations in the minibuffer
- [[https://github.com/minad/consult][Consult]]: Many useful search and navigation commands
- [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][Embark]]: Minibuffer actions and context menu
- [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][Orderless]]: Advanced completion style
